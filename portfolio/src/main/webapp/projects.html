                            <p>The research projects I have been a part of relate to the security of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), which is a network of autonomous vehicles that communicate with one another.

                            <p>FeedbackLoop is an application that aims to facilitate greater communication between students and instructors. 
                                Instructors receive constructive feedback on how their teaching activities can be more effective for their students, 
                                which maximizes the teaching/learning experience for both parties. The web application also features guided tutorials 
                                and support through direct messaging to create a user-friendly interface.
